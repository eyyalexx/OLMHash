CPS633 Lab 1
Question 5 Word Problems

Supposed ‘hashed’ passwords are salted using 4-bit salt values. Discuss the effect of using these salts in terms of computational and storage requirement of the password cracker described in section 3. 

1.


Passwords in this lab are allowed to be up to 12 character long. What happens if someone picks a null password, i.e. a password containing zero characters? Most people select passwords that are 8 characters or less. What is the impact of this on the security of the system? 

2.


Suppose the encryption algorithm, E, used to produce password hashes is weak. For example, the output of the encryption algorithm used in this lab is simply a linear combination of the input bits. How can an attacker use this knowledge to attack the system? What are some of the property of a good cryptographic hash function that can be used to address this weakness? 

3.


4. A typical time period for X number of attempts could be 1 minute, but the best way to utilize a time based lockout system would be to have the lockout time increase after every unsuccessful attempt. Having a fixed lockout time would only change the number of unsuccessful attempts you could make every X period of time, where has having the lockout time increase could lock an attacker out for an impractical amount of time
